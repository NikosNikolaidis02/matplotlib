Thank you for your interest in helping to improve Matplotlib! There are various
ways to contribute to Matplotlib. All of them are super valuable! For example:

- cleaning up and optimizing the code base
- creating and sharing examples of using the library
- detailing unclear and missing documentation
- reporting and fixing bugs
- requesting and implementing new features
- helping the community with all of the above


If you have any questions on the
process or how to fix something feel free to ask on `gitter
<https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_ for short questions and on
`discourse <https://discourse.matplotlib.org>`_ for longer questions.
